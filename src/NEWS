LinuxTag is soon and so is the release of Fedora 7.
We are working to get version 2.0.3 done so we can import
it into Fedora CVS and get all the multimedia stuff done for
LinuxTag. Revisor will have a developer at LinuxTag so we hope
to see you there. Find us at the Fedora booth.

Updated from a feature list we came up with. Revisor now
does Re-Spins and Live-Spins for kickstart package manifests
as well as manual package selection.
